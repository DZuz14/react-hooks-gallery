# React Hooks Photo Gallery

Example of a photo gallery built with React Hooks. Responsive & more advanced version coming soon.

## Use

- `git clone https://github.com/DZuz14/react-hooks-gallery.git`
- `cd react-hooks-gallery`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

If your browser does not automatically open, visit `http://localhost:8080`

## YouTube

There is a tutorial on how to build this as well. The video was recorded before React Hooks were released and uses a class based component. However, the two versions are nearly almost identical in code except for a few minor changes. 100% still worth watching.
